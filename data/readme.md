# Where is the data?

The images were too large to be stored on github easily, so they had to be removed from the
entire git history. A good working set of data can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sblcwj3w47t5hc1/end-to-end-learning-sdc-data.zip?dl=0).

# Can I make my own images

Yes. Check out the instructions for the [Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim).
