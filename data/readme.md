# Where are the images?

The images are found in the `driving_log_images.zip` folder. Unzip it and drop the
files here.

# Why?

To prevent having to track many image files, the `run_name/IMG` folders
are not tracked. Instead, we keep all the images in the `driving_log_images.zip`
folder and update the content here if any new images are added.

Since it is helpful to track what images _are_ used or removed, the
`run_name/driving_log.csv` files _are_ tracked in git.
